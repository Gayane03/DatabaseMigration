			<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" GutterBottom="true">
				Migrating relational databases presents several challenges:
			</MudText>
			<MudList T="string">
				<MudListItem><p>Schema Differences: Source and target databases may have different data types, constraints, and indexing strategies.</p></MudListItem>
				<MudListItem><p>Data Type Mappings: Mapping data types between different SQL dialects requires careful consideration to avoid data loss or corruption.</p></MudListItem>
				<MudListItem><p>Foreign Key Constraints: Maintaining referential integrity during migration is crucial to prevent data inconsistencies.</p></MudListItem>

		<MudExpansionPanel Text="Migration Strategies">
			<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" GutterBottom="true">
				Several strategies can be employed for database migration:
			</MudText>
			<MudList T="string">
				<MudListItem>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">Dump and Restore:</MudText>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
						A common approach involves creating a dump of the source database and restoring it to the target database. This is simple for homogenous migrations (same database engine), but requires careful schema adjustments for heterogeneous migrations (different database engines).
					</MudText>
				</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">Schema and Data Migration Tools:</MudText>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
						Specialized tools can automate schema and data migration, handling data type mappings and constraint conversions. These tools often provide features for data transformation and validation. Examples are tools provided by the database vendor, or third-party tools like AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
					</MudText>
				</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):</MudText>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
						ETL processes can be used to extract data from the source database, transform it as needed, and load it into the target database. This approach provides flexibility for complex data transformations and can be used for both homogenous and heterogeneous migrations.
					</MudText>
				</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">Incremental Migration:</MudText>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
						For large databases, incremental migration can minimize downtime by migrating data in batches. This approach involves initially migrating a subset of the data and then migrating subsequent changes incrementally.
					</MudText>
				</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.subtitle2">Dual Writes and Read Switching:</MudText>
					<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
						Applications write data to both the old and new database. Once data is consistent, Reads are switched to the new database. Then, the application stops writing to the old database. This is a very low downtime method.
					</MudText>

		<MudExpansionPanel Text="Tools and Technologies">
			<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" GutterBottom="true">
				Several tools and technologies can assist with database migration:
			</MudText>
			<MudList T="string">
				<MudListItem>Database Vendor Tools: Most database vendors provide tools for migration, such as SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) and Oracle SQL Developer Migration Workbench.</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>AWS Database Migration Service (DMS): A cloud-based service for migrating databases to AWS.</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>Azure Database Migration Service: Azure's equivalent to AWS DMS.</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>Third-Party Tools: Tools like Talend, Informatica, and Attunity Replicate provide advanced data integration and migration capabilities.</MudListItem>
				<MudListItem>Open Source Tools: Tools like pg_dump/pg_restore (PostgreSQL) and mysqldump/mysql (MySQL) are useful for certain migration scenarios.</MudListItem>
